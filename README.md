# ML-for-UCI-Online-Retail
This project entails using machine learning techniques Clustering, Classification and Regression to analyse and harness insights from the UCI online dataset. 
Please access the UCI Online Retail 2 dataset here DOI:10.24432/C5CG6D
This project mainly uses 3 types of machine learning techniques and explores different algorithms, preproccessing techniques and model selection results

Attached: 
1. A report that outlines the steps taken and insights drawn from the machine learning methods
2. Jupyter notebook of code where the graphs used in the report are plot
